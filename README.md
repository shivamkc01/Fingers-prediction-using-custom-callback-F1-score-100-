# Finger prediction using custom callback and acheive F1 score 100%

The goal of the project is to build a model able to count fingers as weel as distinguish between left and right hand.

# Dataset content
21600 images of left and right hands fingers.
All images are 128 by 128 pixels.
- Training set : 18000 images
- Test set: 3600 images
- Images are centerd by the center of mass
- Noise pattern on the backgound

# Labels
Labels are in 2 last characters of file name L/R indicates left/right hand; 0,1,2,3,4,5 indicates number of fingers.
# Note
Images of a left hand were generated by flipping images of right hand.

# Custom Callbacks called ALRCallback function </br>
I have used by custom callbacks that will control the learning rate and print training data in details. The callback aslo includes a feature to periodically ask if you want to train for N more epochs or Halt.

# You can install it by writting..

If you want to learn more about how this custom callback works then I highly recommanded to check out the pypi website discription on this library.

# Down below image is showing the format for my custom callback library.
Also it helps to hold control model while training by adjusting the learning rate or add more epochs or halt the training.
